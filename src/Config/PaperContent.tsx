  abstract:
    'Versatile audio super-resolution (SR) aims to predict high-frequency components from low-resolution audio across diverse domains such as speech, music, and sound effects. Existing diffusion-based SR methods often fail to produce semantically aligned outputs and struggle with consistent high-frequency reconstruction. In this paper, we propose SAGA-SR, a versatile audio SR model that combines semantic and acoustic guidance. Based on a DiT backbone trained with a flow matching objective, SAGA-SR is conditioned on text and spectral roll-off embeddings. Due to the effective guidance provided by its conditioning, SAGA-SR robustly upsamples audio from arbitrary input sampling rates between 4 kHz and 32 kHz to 44.1 kHz. Both objective and subjective evaluations show that SAGA-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance across all test cases.',
